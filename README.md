# What do we want to do?
In this repository, different parts of the network such as services, protocols, topologies, hardware and software, and other communications and services are simulated and uploaded separately by Cisco Packet Tracer software.
Also, in this project, all Cisco devices and operating systems are used, and instructions, documents and explanations related to each part are placed in that part.

# Why Cisco Packet Tracer?
Cisco Packet Tracer software is a network simulation program using Cisco equipment. Easy to use, import and export of final files and better output and instant viewing of results are among the advantages of this software compared to Simulators.
Also, launching and managing software such as gns3 is difficult for novice users, and for this reason, in this repository, all projects and work are done on Cisco Packet Tracer so that we can easily understand how to function and implement various network services.

# Support and training
The output files of each part of the network are uploaded separately in files. All commands, techniques and equipment used will be fully listed and documented.
Also, if there are any questions or ambiguities in the files, you can contact me via email and ask your questions.
